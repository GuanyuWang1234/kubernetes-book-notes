# Kubernetes's primer

Kubernetes is an orchestrator of containerized cloud native applications

## Orchestration
Kubernetes deploys applications, scale up and down, self-heal, perform rollout and rollbacks, without me having to get involved

## Containerization
Containerization is the process of packaging applications and dependences as images and then running them in containers

## Cloud native
Cloud native applications possess cloud like features like autoscaling and automatic updates

## Microservices
Micro services applications are built from many small specialized independent parts. A common pattern is to deploy each micro service as its own container.

### Kubernetes and docker
Kubernetes now uses containerd as the default runtime. But docker, containerd, and Kubernetes all implement the OCI standards. 

##  Kubernetes is the operating system of the cloud

Kubernetes abstract Cloud resources and schedules application microservices. It doesn't care about the specific cloud, and it hides the details of clouds
